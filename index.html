    <div> 
      <p>During my long career I've worked on countless websites for 
        some of the most prestigous tech companies in the world. 
        My talent in web development has been recognized by some of top 
        talent in the field and by most major world leaders.
        Although there are too many to include on this humble page, 
        I will list some of my most successful projects.</p>

      <figcaption>"Its an amazing website, I'm enamored, whenever they 
        call a timeout I'm always on my BlackBerry sneaking a peek of the SpaceJam website.
      Seeing the SpaceJam webpage gives me the strength to do my signature "Slam Dunks" 
      and my other Basketball moves like the "Dribble". I love this website so much that 
      I'm changing my name to Michael SpaceJamWebsite" -Michael SpaceJamWebsite (Formerly Michael Jordan)

        the best website I could have hoped for. Everything on this webpage speaks to Jeffrey's
        excellence as a webdeveloper. No one else could have made something like this"

      <figcaption>"I must visit this website everyday. To me this is the peak of web design. I see this 
        webpage as less of a website and more of a work of art. The skill needed to create something of
        this caliber is unfathomable, and I will be forever grateful to Mr. Kolvites for creating this website
        for me. Its unbelievable what you can do with computers and just a bit of talent" -Jane Park.org/main.html
